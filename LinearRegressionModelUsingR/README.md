# Linear Model for Predicting House Prices


Home prices are of obvious and immediate interest to all three of us from a personal and financial perspective. The real estate market has short- and long-term impacts on lifestyle and financial decisions we make for our families. Empirically, many variables have been used to price a house. Some common predictors are number of bedrooms or bathrooms, square footage, or year built. How do these and other predictors influence the price of a house? Could there be an interplay between predictors that would help with our prediction?

Our housing data comes from Kaggle. This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.
