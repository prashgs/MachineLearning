## Introduction

Home prices are of obvious and immediate interest to all three of us from a personal and financial perspective. The real estate market has short- and long-term impacts on lifestyle and financial decisions we make for our families. Empirically, many variables have been used to price a house. Some common predictors are number of bedrooms or bathrooms, square footage, or year built. How do these and other predictors influence the price of a house? Could there be an interplay between predictors that would help with our prediction?
  
  ## Methods
  
  ### Cleaning the Data
  
  - Transform "year built" dates into "age"
- na.omit

### Data Exploration

- Check for collinearity issues (Matt)
- Ensure that LINE assumptions are met (Prashanth)



- Influential points (Qi)

### Model Building
